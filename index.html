                    To reach your potential buyers, you have to know who they are, where they spend their time online,
                    and
                    how they make their buying decisions. Agents who use luxury real estate marketing services are able
                    to
                    identify your niche market, then create paid ads on Facebook, Google, Instagram, and YouTube that
                    reach
                    those interested in your property. These paid ad campaigns are highly customized and targeted,
                    ensuring
                    you are not spending money marketing to those who are not in the market for a property such as
                    yours.

                    Content is one of the most powerful resources a real estate agent has to promote your property.
                    Being able to create high-quality content such as video and copywriting is an essential tool that
                    elevates the agents who use luxury real estate marketing services above their competitors. According
                    to a recent survey, 85 percent of buyers and sellers want to work with an agent who uses videoâ€”and
                    for good reason. An agent who uses video is able to connect with potential buyers on a deeper level
                    and build trust and rapport. When they use video to market your property, they are showing viewers
                    what it would really be like to walk through and live in your homeâ€”something that is much more
                    difficult to do with a written description.
                    <!-- <br><br>
                    However, written descriptionsâ€”or copywritingâ€”is also important. Your property needs to be described
                    in appealing and vibrant terms on the listing and on any additional marketing that is created to
                    sell it. Those agents who work with Luxury Presence get access to experienced real estate
                    copywriters who create blogs, website copy, and content marketing pieces that make your property
                    attractive to potential buyers. -->

                    Recent research has shown that 44% of buyers found the home they purchased on the internet. Many of
                    them simply googled the search terms that they wanted in a new home and started their search that
                    way. For your home to show up in these types of searches, your real estate agent needs to use the
                    right terms in your online marketing. The effective use of these terms is referred to as search
                    engine optimization or SEO. The process of identifying and correctly using the right terms is a bit
                    of a scienceâ€”one that the SEO experts at Luxury Presence have mastered. When a potential buyer
